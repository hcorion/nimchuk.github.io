The word comes from the Old Church Slavonic word нѣмьць, which means a German or at least someone who spoke German or, in ancient Proto-Slavic could also mean foreigner (ie. someone who didn&amp;rsquo;t speak the native slavic language). In modern Ukrainian the word is німець (pronounced nimetz in English) and still has a similar meaning.
This explains the first part of Nimchuk, but you may be wondering about what the -chuk part means.</description></item></channel></rss>
